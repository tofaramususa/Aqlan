# Answer grader instructions
answer_grader_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. 

You will be given a QUESTION and a STUDENT ANSWER. 

Here is the grade criteria to follow:

(1) The STUDENT ANSWER helps to answer the QUESTION

Score:

A score of yes means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria. This is the highest (best) score. 

The student can receive a score of yes if the answer contains extra information that is not explicitly asked for in the question.

A score of no means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria. This is the lowest possible score you can give.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. 

Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""

# answer = "The Llama 3.2 models released today include two vision models: Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct and Llama 3.2 90B Vision Instruct, which are available on Azure AI Model Catalog via managed compute. These models are part of Meta's first foray into multimodal AI and rival closed models like Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku and OpenAI's GPT-4o mini in visual reasoning. They replace the older text-only Llama 3.1 models."
