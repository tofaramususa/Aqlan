#### Current Status

Maritime Connectivity Grade:
- Current Value: 40/100
- Limited ferry routes and aging fleet, resulting in insufficient services and ineffective inter-island transport

Inter-island Transit Time:
- Current Time: 90 minutes average
- Long travel periods due to operational inefficiency and infrastructure limitations

Passenger Satisfaction:
- Current Rate: 65% of users satisfied with services
- Inconsistent service quality with frequent complaints about reliability and comfort

Annual Emissions:
- Current Level: 120,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually
- Current fleet's dependence on fossil fuels leads to high carbon footprint, threatening environmental sustainability

Abu Dhabi needs a comprehensive strategy for infrastructure development, fleet modernization, and sustainable solutions adoption to improve maritime connectivity in line with Vision 2035.

#### Current State

Infrastructure:
- Ferry terminals lack modern technology and integrated services
- Absence of integrated service centers connecting maritime and land transport

Fleet and Services:
- Current fleet lacks maintenance and technological updates
- Insufficient daily trips compared to increasing demand

Organization and Management:
- Absence of smart system for operations management and resource allocation
- Lack of regulatory framework promoting maritime safety and sustainability

Environment:
- Significant environmental impacts from fleet emissions
- Degradation of marine ecosystems due to unsustainable operations
